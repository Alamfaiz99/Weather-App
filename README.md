- **Unit Selection:** Choose between Celsius and Fahrenheit units for temperature.
- **Get Current Location:** Optionally, you can click "Get Current Location" to fetch weather data for your current location.
- **Error Handling:** If the location is not found or if there is an API request issue, appropriate error messages will be displayed.

## How to Use:

1. Enter a location (e.g., "New York" or "90210") in the input field.
2. Choose the desired temperature unit (Celsius or Fahrenheit) from the dropdown.
3. Click "Get Weather" to fetch and display weather data.
4. Optionally, click "Get Current Location" to fetch weather data for your current location (requires geolocation permission).

## Additional Information:

- This project uses the OpenWeatherMap API for weather data. Make sure to replace 'YOUR_API_KEY' in `script.js` with your actual API key from OpenWeatherMap.
- The web application is designed to be responsive and work on both desktop and mobile devices.

Feel free to explore the code and customize the styles and design to your liking.
